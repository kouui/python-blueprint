# source code architecture summary

## purpose

read all files in the src/ directory recursively and create a detailed file level source code architecture summary.
and then base your sumarry modify the `### source code architecture` section in `.roorules` file.

## requirements

1. we already have some draft in the `.roorules` file, you should modify it to make it more detailed and accurate.
2. if there is function/class definition in the source file, you should write a summary for it.
3. do not make any modification to other sections in the `.roorules` file.
4. you should also read the `__init__.py` file in each module
5. in your summary, use path instead of module name, for example **`src/pz_auto_test/io`** instead of **`pz_auto_test.io`**
6. in your summary, for function/class in a file, use list to separate them
